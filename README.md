Toy Store KPI Dashboard

Project Purpose
This Power BI dashboard was designed to give the toy store owner a clear, visual overview of their business's performance. The goal is to make it easy to see what's working and where there might be opportunities to improve, so the owner can make smart, data-driven decisions.
Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard provides a quick look at essential business metrics:
 * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The top of the dashboard features three large cards that show the Total Orders, Revenue, and Profit for the most recent period.
 * Performance Over Time: The Revenue by Month chart shows how sales are trending, helping to identify seasonal patterns or the impact of specific promotions.
 * Breakdown by Category: The Total Orders by Category bar chart reveals which product types—like Toys, Arts & Crafts, or Electronics—are the most popular with customers.
 * Store-Specific Performance: You can easily filter the data by store location (Airport, Commercial, Downtown, or Residential) to compare performance and see what’s happening at each individual site.

How to Use This Dashboard
 * Open the dashboard file in Power BI.
 * Review the summary numbers at the top for a quick snapshot of overall performance.
 * Use the store location buttons to switch views and analyze a specific store.
 * Look at the charts to understand monthly trends in revenue and see how different product categories are performing.
 * Use the filters on the right side of the screen for more detailed analysis.

   
Potential Next Steps
This dashboard is a great starting point, and we can make it even more powerful by adding:
 * Profitability by Category: A chart that shows which product categories are the most profitable, not just the ones with the most orders.
 * Best-Selling Items: A report that lists the top-selling individual products to help with inventory management.
 * Customer Insights: New visuals that show data about the most loyal customers or customer demographics.
